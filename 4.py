Count number of trees in a forest

# Python3 program to count number
# of trees in a forest.

# A utility function to add an
# edge in an undirected graph.
def addEdge(adj, u, v):
	adj[u].append(v)
	adj[v].append(u)

# A utility function to do DFS of graph
# recursively from a given vertex u.

	visited[u] = True
	for i in range(len(adj[u])):
		if (visited[adj[u][i]] == False):

# Returns count of tree is the
# forest given as adjacency list.

	res = 0
	for u in range(V):
